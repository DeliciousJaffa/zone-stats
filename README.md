# RPUK Zone Stats

## What is this?
This website fetches data about the capture zones from [Roleplay UK](https://roleplay.co.uk) and displays it in a nice fashion. You can find it here: <https://zonestats.nomad.gdn>.

*The website uses information fetched from the Roleplay UK API, it is however not an official website and is not made nor maintained by Roleplay UK.*
